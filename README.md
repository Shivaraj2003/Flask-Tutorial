# Flask Learning Repository: Electronic Health Records (EHR) Project  

Welcome to my Flask learning repository! This repository documents my journey of learning Flask through hands-on practice with an **Electronic Health Records (EHR)** project.  

## Project Overview  

The EHR project is a web application designed for healthcare providers to manage patient records efficiently. The key feature is allowing doctors to upload an audio file that is converted into text and stored in the database, along with additional details about the patient and their diagnosis.  

### Key Features  
- **Audio-to-Text Conversion**: Doctors can upload audio files describing patient details, which are converted to text using OpenAI Whisper.  
- **Patient Management**: Input and store patient name, diagnosed disease, symptoms, and prescribed medications.  
- **Database Storage**: All patient details, including the converted text, are securely stored in the database.  


## Learning Objectives  
- Integrate Flask with audio-to-text conversion tools like OpenAI Whisper.  
- Handle file uploads and process them securely in a web application.  
- Use Flask-SQLAlchemy for database management.  
- Implement form handling and validation in Flask.
